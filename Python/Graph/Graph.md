# Graph

A Graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes.

## Implementation

The Graph implementation in this repository consists of nodes and edges. Each node contains data, and edges represent connections between nodes.

## Methods

### `add_node(data)`

Adds a new node with the specified data to the graph.

### `add_edge(node1, node2)`

Adds an edge between the nodes `node1` and `node2` in the graph.

### `remove_node(data)`

Removes the node with the specified data from the graph, along with its incident edges.

### `remove_edge(node1, node2)`

Removes the edge between the nodes `node1` and `node2` from the graph.

### `display()`

Displays the nodes and edges of the graph.
