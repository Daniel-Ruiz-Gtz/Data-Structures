# Stack

A Stack is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure that follows the order of insertion and removal. Elements are added (pushed) and removed (popped) from the same end, typically referred to as the "top" of the stack.

## Implementation

The Stack implementation in this repository uses a Python list to store elements. The top of the stack corresponds to the end of the list.

## Methods

### `push(item)`

Adds the specified item to the top of the stack.

### `pop()`

Removes and returns the item from the top of the stack.

### `peek()`

Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.

### `is_empty()`

Returns `True` if the stack is empty, `False` otherwise.
