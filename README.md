# Python Data Structures

Welcome to the Python Data Structures repository! This project provides simple and efficient implementations of fundamental data structures in Python. Whether you're a learner exploring the basics or a developer seeking reliable implementations, you'll find valuable resources here.

## Data Structures

- **Stack**: Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure.
- **Queue**: First In, First Out (FIFO) structure.
- **Linked List**: A sequence of elements with each element pointing to the next.
- **Tree**: A hierarchical structure with a root node and branches.
- **Graph**: A collection of nodes connected by edges.
- **Hash Table**: A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function.

## How to Use

Enter each folder in the data structure, and you will be able to review a Markdown document with relevant information, along with a Python file containing the practical example.

```bash
python -m dataStructure.py
```
